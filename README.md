## Project Report
\n\n
### High-level summary
\n
The project is a {heading}. It's built in a domain that covers {details['domain']}, with the tech stack including Python, Django for web development and PostgreSQL as our database. The codebase consists of multiple modules. \n\nAt a high level, there are approximately {details['scale']} files (classes, functions, constants).\n\n### Project structure\nThe project is structured in an organized fashion with clear responsibility for each top-level package/folder -\n{tree}. These folders represent different areas of the system and serve as the building blocks to build our applications. \n\nEach folder has a specific role:\n- {tree['folder1']}\n- {tree['folder2']}\n- ...\n\n### Detailed component breakdown\nDetailed understanding of each package/module would require us to look at these significant classes, functions and constants -\n{details}. These components contribute towards the functionality, logic flow of the system. Some key classes in this module are: \n1. {details['class1']} is responsible for ...\n2. {details['class2']} performs ...\n3. ...\n\n### Inter-module relationships & workflows\nThe interactions or dependencies between major components could be summarized as follows -\n{relationships}. This shows how each component fits into the larger picture of the application and what other parts they interact with. \n\nHigh entry points for development are these: {entry_points}\n\n### Metadata for AI parsing\nThe metadata provides a structured context for an AI to parse this project -\n{metadata}. This is useful because it allows automated reasoning, making the system more efficient and scalable.\n\nCritical classes/functions in the module are highlighted here: \n- {critical_classes}\n- {critical_functions}\n\n### Onboarding guidance\nTo start contributing to this project, one can consider these steps -\n{onboarding}. These conventions and patterns were followed while building this project which can be useful for developers new to it. \n\n### Conclusion\nThis detailed report gives a comprehensive understanding of the {heading} project structure. It provides insights into its high-level architecture, intermodule relationships, and much more. This knowledge is invaluable for onboarding new team members, providing context for AI models, or even helping to maintain existing codebase efficiently. \n\nHappy coding!\n\n\n
